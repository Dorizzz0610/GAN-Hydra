* What is the role of the discriminator in a GAN model? Use this project's discriminator as an example.

* The generator network in this code base takes two arguments: `noise` and `labels`.
What are these inputs and how could they be used at inference time to generate an image of the number 5?

* What steps are needed to deploy a model into production?

* If you wanted to train with multiple GPUs, 
what can you do in pytorch lightning to make sure data is allocated to the correct GPU? 


- Using git, keep the existing git history and add your code contribution on top of it. Follow git best practices as you see fit. We appreciate readability in the commits
- Add a section at the top of this README, containing your answers to the questions, as well as the output `wandb` graphs and images resulting from your training run. You are also invited to talk about difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them
- Link to your git repository in your email reply and share it with us/make it public

# Chatbot Assignment:

To complete this assignment, you are required to create assistants in [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/settings/assistants/new) and address the following questions:

* Compare atleast 3 different models and provide insights on Content Quality, Contextual Understanding, Language Fluency and Ethical Considerations with examples.

* What are the parameters that can be used to control response. Explain in detail.

* Explore various techniques used in prompt engineering, such as template-based prompts, rule-based prompts, and machine learning-based prompts and provide what are the challenges and considerations in designing effective prompts with examples.

* What is retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) and how is it applied in natural language generation tasks?
